# AI-for-Medicine
This repository contains the assignments and the learners' notebooks for AI-for-Medicine specialization on Coursera.

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ 
future health, and recommend better treatments. This three-course Specialization gave me practical experience in applying machine 
learning to concrete problems in medicine.
These courses go beyond the foundations of deep learning to teach the nuances in applying AI to medical use cases.
